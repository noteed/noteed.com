# 2020-07-04

- I have written a small `.github/worflows` file. It uses my `design-system`
  repository to build an HTML file and publish it to GitHub Pages.
  [More](https://github.com/noteed/actions).
- I have started to play with Datasette. I have written a small script to
  export some Git commits into a SQLite database, and created a custom
  Datasette Docker image to support HTML links (using the `datasette-json-html`
  plugin).
