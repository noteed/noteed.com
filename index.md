I'm Thu, and I use this space to try to share computing stuff, mainly related
to Nix.

I haven't updated my [blog](/blog/) for a while, but have recently created a
[video](/videos/). You can also read short [notes](/notes/), content about
[not-os](/not-os), a Nix+runit system image, and finally the
[nix-notes](/nix-notes/) are about a NixOS system image.

You can see other things I've done on [GitHub](https://github.com/noteed) and
reach me [`@noteed`](https://twitter.com/noteed) on Twitter or using the same
handle at `gmail.com`.

You can also find me
on [Post News](https://post.news/noteed) and reach me on Mastodon:
<a rel="me" href="https://mas.to/@noteed"><code>@noteed@mas.to</code></a>.
